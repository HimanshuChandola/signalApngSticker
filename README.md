# signalApngSticker
Convert Telegram Stickers (tgs) to Apng (&lt;300) kb for Signal
And uploads it while you grab a coffee and makes sure you have it to send it 
to friends when you are back :")

---
This is my first github repo, do give me suggestions!!
---
What do I need to run this program? Linux
What do I need to install beforehand? Good question, Here's the list.
1. gifsicle 
2. imagemagick 
3. apngasm 
4. tgs-to-gif

For v2 you need 2 more things to be preinstalled
run on your system 

1. sudo pip install python-telegram-bot
2. sudo pip install signalstickers-client

---
You can easily find these in your repo or AUR 
With v2 you will be able to download these using script except for tgs-to-gif 
For python requirements run pip commands 

---

## V2 of the script is handles uploading by it's own !!!!
What does v2 of this script does?

Does all mentioned tasks of v1 , and then make stickerpack , uploads it
Give you stickerpack link :")

For v2 you need just the link to stickerpack, NO NEED TO DOWNLOAD TGS FILES
Just have "https://t.me/addstickers/HalloUtya" and that's enough !!!!

While setting up v2 for first time you might be asked some info for stickerpack-script
for bot to upload on your behalf.

Also you will need to setup a telegram bot using t.me/BotFather and get token of it :")

Once done, from next time just sending link would be enough.

What do this script do? (Just v1 )
1. Convert tgs to gif
2. optimize that gif
3. breaks gif into frames
4. Make apng out of those frames



How do i do this?
1. Install above mentioned packages
2. Copy your tgs into a folder
3. Copy this script to same folder
4. Run it!!
5. Wait for cpu to cook your apngs
6. Look for all apngs in ./output/
7. Create stickerpack using those apngs all are below 300kb !!!

You say so, but what have you done??? 
(some of these were done using giff-older which used gif from @StickerDownloadBot of telegram it had artifacts, newer script.sh solves this issue where there were artifacts)

[Contains 60+ stickerpack as of now ported from Telegram](https://signalstickers.com/?s=author%3A%22Navneet%20Vikram%20Tey%22)
